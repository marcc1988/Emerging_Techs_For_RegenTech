Emerging technology report

This report will discuss the feasible emerging technologies and practices in the field of digital agriculture that will fit RegenTech’s strategic development plan for the next 5 years. I have researched a number of sources including leading industry leaders such as professional bodies like ACS (Australian Computing Society), Technology giants like Google and IT industry journals: https://www.sciencedirect.com,

There are 3 emerging technology will benefit RegenTech.
1.Internet of Things

The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to devices or ‘things’ embedded with sensors so they can measure and transmit data via a network. When it comes to IoT in agriculture, a ‘thing’ could be a tractor, shed, weather station or sheep. It could even be a person.

IoT devices connect and interact with each other and the internet, which means they can work together to send alerts or automate other ‘things’ such as sprinkler in an orchard. The data IoT devices generate is often sent to what is known as an interface or dashboard. This is where farmers access the information they need, often in real-time, to make more informed decisions.

Practices for RegenTech: IoT sensors can be applied to RegenTech’s clients farming fields so that the data collected by the IoT sensors can provide a real-time picture of what’s going on in the field. This means that farmers will be able to know when their crops are ripe, how much water is being used and if an irrigation system is needed, soil health, and whether they need more fertilizer or any other input.

2. AR farming
   Implementation of AR in farming will help in improving farm production. Augmented Reality in agriculture plays a metamorphic role in the field – check and pest/insect detection process. Moreover, it also determines the soil properties and crops to be sown on a particular piece of land. AR helps in understanding pest and crop conditions just by looking at the application.

Practices for RegenTech: AR technology can be used to show vivid presentations of the new technologies used on their client’s farming property by overlaying the RengenTech infrastructure over the aerial images.

3. Drone technology
   With the use of drones, they can get an overview of their fields and collect data much faster and more efficiently than traditional methods. Drones will allow farmers to see how healthy their plants are, where they might need water or nutrients, and if there is any pest activity before it gets out of control.

Practices for RegenTech: Using drone technology for aerial imagery rather than a helicopter will dramatically reduce the cost of this component. It will also allow them to survey potential client’s farms to show them a proof of concept with minimal costs.
