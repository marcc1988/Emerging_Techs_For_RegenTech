## Features and Functions

IoT Sensors:
Remote sensing in agriculture is revolutionizing the way data is acquired from different nodes in a farm' IoT-based remote sensing utilizes sensors placed along with the farms like weather stations for gathering data, which is transmitted to analytical tools for analysis. Sensors are devices sensitive to anomalies. Farmers can monitor the crops from the analytical dashboard and take action based on insights.

Sensors placed along the farms monitor the crops for changes in light, humidity, temperature, shape, and size. Any anomaly detected by the sensors is analyzed and the farmer is notified. Thus remote sensing can help prevent the spread of diseases and keep an eye on the growth of crops.

AR farming:
AR technology can be used for monitoring farms visually. Farmers have to check the fertility of their lands to select the most suitable crop they want to sow in the farm. AR can augment fertility inspection. With AR, farmers can visualize the entire farm in a single dashboard, monitor the overall production quality and detect the presence of any pest or insect infestation.

Training new farmers. AR can enable new farmers to get familiar with agricultural equipment through immersive e-learning environments. AR will help new farmers to visually learn the use of complex agriculture tools minimizing at the same time serious accidents. It will also facilitate remote collaboration with and training from farmers who are experts in using advanced precision agricultural methods and techniques.

Drone technology:
Aerial drones, which equipped with fixed wings, a rotor, and a remote control, can be used for image recording, field surveillance, etc. The information will be later used for making interactive visuals with the help of augmented reality to make it easily and affordably available to the clients. Apart from surveillance and picture capture capabilities, drones can also perform a vast number of tasks that previously required human labor: planting crops, fighting pests and infections, agriculture spraying, crop monitoring, etc.

## Impact Analysis

Cost of Implementation:
Setting up new emerging technologies like drones, IoT sensors and AR devices in the farmlands is going to need some initial investment. For example, the average cost of developing IoT based devices for Smart farming will be in the range of $10000-$11000. The cost of drones can be vary depending on which device you choose to use. Spending roughly $50,000 for a drone may seem like a lot. These drones are robust and durable though, so they’ll continue providing cost-saving benefits for years to come. The return on investment will depend on the size of the agribusiness, the number of crops or stocks, and the frequency of planting and spraying.

Cost of Removal
The cost of removal of IoT sensors are very little significant in terms of the returns from the farms as a result of increased productivity within short period of time.

Legal and Regulatory Responsibilities.
The privacy and ownership of the massive data collected by IoT would be the major concern for the farmers. Also, drones on farm fields can cause danger for other aviation activities operated by airlines or military.
