### Emerging Technology Strategy report for RegenTech

Digital capabilities are critical in the new era of RegenTech and our implementation of new technologies is just part of our commitment to help equip our farmlands with the abilities to match the future agriculture industry. From previous research and analysis, we’ve decided to introduce 3 new technologies to upgrade Regen Tech’s core business and increase the company’s effectiveness in the agricultural sector.

Automation Department and Decision Support Department will use IoT Sensors so that smart sensors can be used for collecting soil data or weather conditions to improve farming system's capabilities to adapt to different climate situations, and expand farming operations to more areas of the farm such as reducing time spent driving a tractor. Datasets collected by sensors will be analysis and presented by data visualization software which will also digitalize communication methods through cloud-based content sharing instead of traditional paper-based mailing.

Planning Department will implement Drone technology and AR technology to perform aerial imaging tasks thus reduce the cost of helicopters and to provide interactive training materials for farmers.

### Potential threats, opportunities, and changes with emerging technology practices at RegenTech.

The main threats of Drone technology is that manipulation of drones needs extra training for farmers. Also, it could be misused and fly into banned area which would pose a threat to military and commercial aviation security. We will have to provide specific guidance on how to use drones and learning relevant regulations in local areas before full implementation.

The threat of IoT sensors would be caused by internet cyber-attack which could lead to stealing or sabotaging crucial datasets that collected by sensors in the farm fields.

Aside from the threats posed by these emerging technologies, the long-term benefits of controlled use of these technologies outweighs our expectations. Implementing these practises will assist to reduce the cost of the currently expensive practises and make it faster to prepare visualisation guides for clients, as well as completely eliminating time delays in service delivery. This will be an excellent addition to the decision support team, speeding up their work and making it more accessible to clients. It will be much easier for famers to access training materials at their own pace by using digital AR interactive platforms, in a way that is more understandable with augmented reality concepts when using new practises at RegenTech.

### How the emerging technologies and practices relate to RegenTech organisational goals.

All of the emerging practises mentioned here are related to and tailored to the needs of RegenTech in terms of lowering costs, reducing time delays, producing meaningful reports to clients on time, creating easily understandable and visual content for clients, and achieving maximum results by automating and adapting current systems.

### Changes and steps to help achieve the goals

The first stage will be to make adjustments to the old system and run many trials with the new technologies to assess their success and durability in order to minimise future losses.

Initially, a trial operation will be conducted for staff, and based on their input, the following phase of testing will be executed on client’s farmlands. Then, RegenTech will request some of the farmers volunteer for trail runs with new gadgets and methods.

Trials for those new technologies will be conducted separately, we will first test drones and then move to AR software and IoT sensors. All trails will be finished within 1-3 months.

After the trails and presentations, we will purchase suitable drones and filming equipments as well as signing documents for the licensing, accreditation of the drone user, insurance and even a training course if necessary. Using drones for aerial photography will instantly reduce the company’s current costs as it will no longer need to pay for fuel, maintenance and other helicopter-related costs.

The following stage is to integrate AR technology into the company and digitise the short course for the farmers. This will help with communicating how the company's proposed improvements for custom farm plans would look by allowing prospective farmers to learn and interact with their plans on their own time and on their own farms, reducing the need for farmers to be on site for the free short course. This effort will also expands Regen Tech's reach and enables staff to contact farmers who were previously interested in the solutions you provide but were unable to reach an agreement due to incapacity to attend onsite.

The last step of the plan is integrate IoT sensors into the business and eliminate the need for human data processing and data entry. By incorporating data collection and AI algorithms into this part of the business, the company will be able to generate datasets to farmers to analysis future planning. Moreover, because this technology is fully digital, we can just send email all to the customer on relevant updates, which will eliminate delays and resolving the issue of farmers getting paper letters with much delays.

## Summary & Conclusion

In conclusion, based on previous analysis and studies on several factors such as impact analysis, trial results, ruling out potential drawbacks, and client reviews on these new emerging technologies, it is clear that these practises are suitable for greater organisational goals and there will be no major negative impacts on the overall system of RegenTech with the adoption of these new technologies.
